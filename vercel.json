Add the following content to your file and we will go through them in details.

    "functions": {

    },
    "routes": [
        {
            "src": "/(.*)",
            "dest": "/api/index.php"
        }
    ],

        "APP_ENV": "production",

version
"version": 2,
//This make sure to run our code on Vercel version 2
functions
"functions": {
    "api/index.php": { "runtime": "vercel-php@0.3.1" }
},
The api/index.php key will define our app entry point which will be forwarded to the Laravel app entry point public/index.php

"runtime": "vercel-php@0.3.1" will define our PHP runtime, which is basically a module that transform our code into Serverless Functions for Vercel.

In this set up we are using the community runtime for PHP called vercel-php.

routes
"routes": [
   {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.php"
   }
],
The routes will tell Vercel to forward all URIs to our application serverless function.

env
"env": {
        "APP_NAME": "Laravel Vercel",
        "APP_ENV": "production",
        "APP_DEBUG": "false",
        "APP_URL": "https://laravel-vercel.vercel.app",

        "APP_CONFIG_CACHE": "/tmp/config.php",
        "APP_EVENTS_CACHE": "/tmp/events.php",
        "APP_PACKAGES_CACHE": "/tmp/packages.php",
        "APP_ROUTES_CACHE": "/tmp/routes.php",
        "APP_SERVICES_CACHE": "/tmp/services.php",
        "VIEW_COMPILED_PATH": "/tmp",
        "CACHE_DRIVER": "array",
        "LOG_CHANNEL": "stderr",
        "SESSION_DRIVER": "cookie",
        "VIEW_COMPILED_PATH": "/tmp/views",
        "SSR_TEMP_PATH": "/tmp/ssr",
        "NODE_PATH": "node"
    }
As you already probably guessed this is going to be our application environment variable section. you can pass environment variables you have on your Laravel app .env.

NOTICE! do not pass sensitive environment values like APP_KEY and database config values since they will be tracked by git and would be visible on your repo. We later will see how we can pass those values in more secure way.

Some of the unusual variables are Laravel's default values that we don't normally see in the our env file. we have to pass them here since serverless applications are state-less and the only folder we can reliably modify at run-time is Vercel‚Äôs tmp folder.

Commit and push Changes to Github
lets push our newly created file to our Github repo

git add .
git commit -m "add Vercel configs"
git push orgin Main

Link our repository to Vercel
Create your free account on Vercel using your Github account.

Once you are done, on your Vercel Dashboard you will see a button called New Project, something similar this the following image.
screencapture-vercel-com-dashboard-1633776362674

When you click on it you see the creation page and your Github repositories listed, on a much similar page like the following.

screencapture-vercel-com-new-1633777753834

Click Import on your laravel-vercel repository (or what ever you named yours).

If you are not seeing your repositories listed, click on the Adjust GitHub App Permissions link and set up the permissions there.

Once you click on import you will see the following like page

You can click on skip for the Create a Team section and go to the Configure Project section.

Screenshot from 2021-10-09 15-01-51

On the Environment Variable section, we will add our sensitive Laravel app env variables.
These are:
APP_KEY
DB_CONNECTION
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_DATABASE
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD

Finally, click on Deploy and sit back to see the magic happen.

Your application will get built and deployed on Vercel. and you will see the following success page with a Vercel domain name to your application.

screencapture-vercel-com-kenean-50-laravel-vercel-1633782165938

Now if you have new changes to be deployed all you have to do is commit and push your changes to your Github repository Main branch and it will automatically get built and deployed to your server, how cool is that!

If you want to change the domain name to your app you can go to the settings tab on Vercel and there is a whole page to set up and manage your domain.

Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

FYI - if anyone is getting error 500 after you deployed, make sure the ‚Äúruntime: ‚Äúvercel-php‚Äù version is up-to-date by checking their Github. The current version I used as of Jan 2022 is 0.4.0.

You can host the database using Devrims Cloud hosting platform. The platform allows you to install any database services like MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, ElasticSearch etc and create multiple databases in a few clicks. You can easily connect the database services with external resources via allowing the IP in the security section of the Devrims platform.
